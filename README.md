Credit Card Fraud Detection System
Overview
This project is a Credit Card Fraud Detection System that uses machine learning to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. The system analyzes transaction patterns and detects anomalies to prevent fraud effectively.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms transaction data for accurate predictions.
Machine Learning Models: Implements algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
Real-time Detection: Predicts fraud using live transaction streams.
Explainability: Provides insights into why a transaction is flagged as fraudulent.
Visualization & Reporting: Displays fraud trends through dashboards and reports.
Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost)
Flask/Django (for API integration)
PostgreSQL / MongoDB (for transaction data storage)
Kafka / RabbitMQ (for real-time transaction processing)
How It Works
Data Collection: Loads transaction data (e.g., time, amount, location, cardholder details).
Feature Engineering: Extracts key fraud indicators (e.g., unusual spending behavior).
Model Training: Trains ML models on historical transaction data.
Fraud Prediction: Classifies new transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Alert Generation: Sends notifications for flagged transactions.
Installation
